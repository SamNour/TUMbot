## Who are we?

We are students from Heilbronn and Munich.
For our task to create an AI bot for helping the lives of students easier, we wanted to make a bot accessible on all platforms.
Windows MAUI was our first goal but ended up with a web GUI using Streamlit in Python and interacted with our modified Azure Open AI APIs.

## What is included here?

We have added every code and data necessary (except the ones provided by TUM student services) to run our modified Azure Open AI model with our GUI after providing it with files.
